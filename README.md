Project Overview

This is the initial version of the project, built as a set of microservices several months ago without Docker. Development on this branch has been paused, and work has since moved to the docker-changes branch, which uses Docker Compose to simplify running the application.

This project implements a distributed microservices-based web application for creating, managing, and signing digital contracts with blockchain verification. It combines traditional web technologies with blockchain to provide secure, verifiable, and transparent contract management.

Note: To run and test the project, please switch to the docker-changes branch or the kubernetes/azure branch. Both require Docker to be installed.
